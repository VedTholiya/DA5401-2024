# DA5401
DA5401 Data Analytics Lab -- Assignments and Solutions

## Course Objectives
* Learn to transform a business problem into a data science problem
* Learn to use Machine Learning to solve data-driven decision making.
* Evaluating the results of Machine Learning modeling.
* Visualization and interpretation of the experimental results.
* Statistical analysis and model selection.

## Prerequisites
* DA5400 or any other equivalent courses on Machine Learning and/or Pattern Recognition
* Fluency in Python programming
* Ability to use third-party libraries such as Sklearn, NumPy, Pandas
* Linux or Mac or Windows WSL environment (Windows native discouraged)

## The Process
* We will meet every week on Monday (P-slot)
* At least one hour of lecture will be given every week to introduce you to the practical aspects of an ML/Analytics topic.
* Students are expected to use the remaining time in the slot to do their assignments or clarify their queries.
* There will be at least **eight** assignments spread across the semester.
* At least **three** assignments will be evaluated in the class within the same evening.
* The remaining take-home assignments will be given **~10 days** for submission.
* The end-semester exam will be a Data Challenge competition.
* 75% weightage to the assignments, 20% to the data challenge (rank + report + viva) and 5% to class interaction.
